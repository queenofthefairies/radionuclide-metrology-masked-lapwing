# Python4LSC code
Test dataset (Ho166m). The 2025 scripts have a modular structure consisting of:     
 - **`pandas4LSC_user` script (you should edit this)**, which calls functions in    
    -  `pandas4LSC_data_processing` (don't edit) to deal with raw data taken at different threshold voltages,     
    - plus `pandas4LSC_data_analysis` (don't edit) to do the regression on the data. 

## Plotting
Scripts to plot the results are still completely separate.    
- **`PlotStuff4LSC_user` script (you should edit this)**, which calls the `plotter` function in    
    -  `PlotStuff4LSC` (don't edit) to plot the linearised threshold data, and a fit of your choice
